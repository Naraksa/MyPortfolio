            <h2 class = "header">My Vision</h2>
                <div class = "image-details">
                    <p>My journey begins with volunteering. Through participating in various programs such as fellowships and student ambassador roles, I aim to enhance my soft skills—particularly communication, leadership, and teamwork—while also broadening my personal and professional network. <br>
                    <br>
                    Alongside these efforts, I plan to pursue a work-study lifestyle to help support my daily expenses and build independence. As I grow both academically and personally, I will seek out opportunities for exchange programs that allow me to travel across different countries, learn about diverse cultures, and take time to relax and recharge.<br>
                    <br>
                    After completing my undergraduate degree, I intend to pursue a master’s degree abroad—continuing to expand my global perspective and deepen my expertise. Eventually, with the knowledge, experience, and values I have gained, I aspire to establish my own business and create something meaningful that reflects my journey and purpose.</p>
